# Destiny Statistics Web App

Although this site is currently not live, the code can be viewed here to see how it works. If you wish to try this yourself, feel free to copy the code, and use another Bungie API key, which can be found in the Bungie Application portal.

This web app is an ongoing project, with further functionalities coming soon.
Currently, it's main function is to find a Destiny 2 player using a search engine. You may type in a players Destiny 2 Bungie Name, and then a list of relevant players to your search appears. If there are multiply players with the same name, you can further filter players with the Identification number in the bungie name. (For ex, there could be multiple people named "Joe" but only one "Joe#1234"). Once you find the player you are looking for, you may click the players name, and some basic information regarding the players in game staistics are returned, along with the players currently equipped emblem.

More features are planned soon, including in depth statistics about certain gamemodes, and an overhaul to the UI.
